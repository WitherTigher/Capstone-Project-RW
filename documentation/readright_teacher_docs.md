# 2. Teacher Quick Start

> Recommended path: **Teachers add students manually in the app.**

This makes sure:

## Step 2 — Create Your Class (if prompted)

You only need to do this once.

This is the default and recommended method.

You have two options:

---

# 3. Adding Students

## Option A — Add Students One by One

1. On the dashboard, tap **Add New Student**.
2. Enter:
   - First name
   - Last name

   - Password
3. Tap **Create Student**.

The student will appear immediately in your roster and can begin using the app.

## Option B — Bulk Upload Students (For Entire Class Rosters)

Once your class is created and students are added, your dashboard shows:

## Class Performance Summary

- **Average Accuracy** for the class.
- **Top Performer**.
- **Students Needing Attention** (accuracy below a certain threshold, such as 70%).

## Most Missed Words

Shows which words your class commonly mispronounces.

Each entry displays:

- The word.

You can use this to guide instruction, small group work, or targeted practice.

## Student List
